# BingoCardMaker
A tool I made to help generator Bingo Cards for my Rover's Fundrasier.

# Dependencies
This has been written for Linux (ubuntu). You will need:
- Python3
- pdflatex (from Tex Live)
- [pypdf](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf)

# Usage
From the root of the repositry, run `python3 main.py`, and enter the number of cards you want. All the Bingo Cards will be combined in main.pdf

If you wish to use it for personal use (and don't want Kananga written all over it) - you will need to chagne the name, and the image file used in [secondhalf](/secondhalf)

# Further Updates
The next stages for developing include:
- Refactor the code
- Change to a better language
